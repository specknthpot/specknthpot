- 👋 Hi, I’m @specknthpot
- 👀 I’m interested in escaping the big tech companies at any cost. From initial circuit design, though the building and programming, to the final 3D print. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C++, Web Design
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Color Maximite Projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can always imagine me: imagine what I would say and do. Imagine contacting me. The imaginary is the seed of the real.
