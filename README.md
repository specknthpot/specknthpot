- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @specknthpot
- I can't believe I chose that handle, wtf was I thinking?
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in escaping the big tech companies at any cost. From initial circuit design, though the building and programming, to the final 3D print. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C++, Web Design
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can always imagine me: imagine what I would say and do. Imagine contacting me. The imaginary is the seed of the real.
Who the hell wrote this? I don't use these f-ing emojis. Nor do I "look to collaberate" I had to erase that. I'm too damn distrustful of people to collaberate. Oh yeah, and I suck at coding.
